Recommendations for Evaluation With Cardiac Imaging Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplements. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-LD 1. In patients with suspected or new-onset HF, or those presenting with acute decompensated HF, a chest x- ray should be performed to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion and to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary, and other diseases that may cause or contribute to the patient’s symptoms (1,2). 1 C-LD 2. In patients with suspected or newly diagnosed HF, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed during initial evaluation to assess cardiac structure and function (3). 1 C-LD 3. In patients with HF who have had a signiﬁcant clinical change, or who have received GDMT and are being considered for invasive procedures or device therapy, repeat measurement of EF, degree of structural remodeling, and valvular function are useful to inform therapeutic interventions (4-7). 1 C-LD 4. In patients for whom echocardiography is inadequate, alternative imaging (e.g., cardiac magnetic reso- nance [CMR], cardiac computed tomography [CT], radionuclide imaging) is recommended for assessment of LVEF (8-15). 2a B-NR 5. In patients with HF or cardiomyopathy, CMR can be useful for diagnosis or management (16-23). 2a B-NR 6. In patients with HF, an evaluation for possible ischemic heart disease can be useful to identify the cause and guide management (24-27). J A C C V O L . 7 9 , N O . 1 7 , 2 0 2 2 Heidenreich et al M A Y 3 , 2 0 2 2 : e 2 6 3 – e 4 2 1 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline e285 Synopsis Cardiac imaging has a key role in the initial evaluation of individuals with suspected HF and, when indicated, in the serial assessment of patients with HF. After a com- plete history and physical examination, a comprehensive TTE is the most useful initial diagnostic test given the vast amount of diagnostic and prognostic information provided. The determination of LVEF is a fundamental step to classify HF and to guide evidence-based pharma- cological and device-based therapy. In certain situations, the echocardiogram is unable to accurately assess cardiac structure and/or function or more information is needed to determine the cause of the cardiac dysfunction. Other imaging modalities, such as CMR, SPECT or radionuclide ventriculography, PET, or cardiac CT or invasive coronary angiography, can provide additional and complementary information to cardiac ultrasound (11). In general, cardiac imaging tests, including repeat tests, are performed only when the results have a meaningful impact on clinical care. Recommendation-Speciﬁc Supportive Text 1. The chest x-ray is a useful initial diagnostic test for the evaluation of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of HF because it assesses cardiomegaly, pulmonary venous congestion, and interstitial or alveolar edema and may reveal alternative causes, cardiopulmonary or otherwise, of the patient’s symp- toms (1,2). Apart from congestion, other ﬁndings on chest x-ray are associated with HF only in the context of clinical presentation. Importantly, cardiomegaly may be absent in acute HF and, although cephalization, interstitial edema, and alveolar edema are modestly speciﬁc for HF, these ﬁndings are relatively insensitive (2,33). Considering the limited sensitivity and speci- ﬁcity, the chest x-ray should not be used as the only determinant of the speciﬁc cause or presence of HF. 2. TTE\n",

Treatment of AF After Cardiac Surgery Synopsis For new-onset AF after cardiac surgery, rate control is typically managed with beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers.1-4 A randomized trial showed no signiﬁcant clinical differences comparing a strategy of rate-control versus rhythm-control medications for patients who are hemodynamically stable.5 For those with poorly controlled AF, cardioversion is reasonable, but for those with >48 hours of AF, imaging of the LAA (even if surgically closed) should be considered.5,6 The use of cardioversion and im- aging in postoperative patients is a judgment call consid- ering the patient’s clinical condition. For patients who develop postoperative AF, including during follow-up postdischarge, rhythm assessment, and possible cardio- version for the small number who are still in AF, should be considered.5,6 Colchicine had been shown to be effective, but more recent studies did not conﬁrm this, and gastro- intestinal adverse effects may be signiﬁcant.8-10 Recommendation-Speciﬁc Supportive Text 1. The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented.1-4 Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective.5 2. The use of rate control or rhythm control are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients because neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients. In this study, patients in the rhythm- control group received amiodarone.5,6 3. Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed, especially for those patients with hemodynamically poorly tolerated AF. Cardio- version is routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone.5,6 4. A review of 8 observational studies that included 15,335 patients found a protective impact on the mor- tality rate at 5 years but no differences in thrombo- embolic events in patients with postoperative AF treated with anticoagulants.7 In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days; in the randomized trial of rate control versus rhythm control, if patients remained in AF or had recurrent AF 48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recom- mended to be continued for 60 days, unless compli- cations occurred. Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm, especially those at high risk for stroke. 5. The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated postdischarge. Patients who tolerate rate control can be followed and often convert spontane- ously after 6 to 8 weeks. A net advantage of rate control is earlier discharge in hemodynamically stable pa- tients. Those who do not convert can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy.5,6 Recommendations for Treatment of AF After Cardiac Surgery Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 A* 1. In postoperative cardiac surgery patients, beta blockers* are recommended to achieve rate control for AF1-4 unless contraindicated or ineffective in which case a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker† is recommended.5 B-R† 1 B-R 2. In hemodynamically stable cardiac surgery patients with postoperative AF, rate-control (target heart rate, <100 bpm) and/or rhythm-control medications are recommended as initial therapy, with the choice of strategy according to patient symptoms, hemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmia, and physician preference.5,6 1 B-R 3. In patients who develop poorly tolerated AF after cardiac surgery, direct current cardioversion in com- bination with antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended, with consideration of imaging to rule out left appendage thrombus before cardioversion in those patients in whom AF has been present >48 hours and who have not been on anticoagulation.5,6 2a B-NR 4. In patients who develop postoperative AF after cardiac surgery, it is reasonable to administer anti- coagulation when deemed safe in regard to surgical bleeding for 60 days after surgery unless compli- cations develop\n",

She is not on home oxygen and does not have chronic lung disease or pneumonia. Her hematocrit level is 45%, white blood cell count is 10 x 10^9/L, platelet count is 380,000/mL, and her last recorded creatinine level is 1.0. She has a history of an IgE mediated reaction to penicillin. What antibiotic should be given to this patient before surgery this week?"
